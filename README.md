# Speech-to-text-conversion-Azure
Custom text-to-speech project using azure cognition AI

In this project I used sdk version 6 of dotnet. 
Although the nuget package doesn't seem to support it, try to install with dotnet globaljson to confirm the version. 
This Program File can speak and write to disk. Only by removing the audioConfig from the SpeechSynthesizer load will it be possible to hear the audio in run mode. 
I just organized a few lines from the azure documentation, any questions go straight to the source on the Azure portal.
